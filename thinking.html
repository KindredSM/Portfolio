          <p>If you feel lost, write.</p>

          <p>
            Most people mistake noise in their head for thought. If something
            feels off in your life, you probably haven't written about it yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            I learned this after six months of what I thought was freedom. Travel,
            flexibility, no real obligations. But once I took a day to be still, I
            saw what I'd been missing. I didn't need to escape responsibility, I
            needed control over my attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            This distinction matters. We talk a lot about freedom, but not enough
            about intention. The world seems to be splitting into those who write
            (and think) and those who don't. I was close to becoming one of the
            latter.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's easy to drift into a passive state, especially when everything
            around you is optimised for distraction. To escape that, you have to
            act deliberately. Clear thinking isn't automatic. In fact, the more
            capable you are, the easier it is to waste that potential chasing the
            wrong things. Potency without clarity is dangerous.
          </p>

          <p>
            One way to get clarity is to shift mental modes from reacting to
            reflecting. Most people operate on autopilot. But if you take time to
            really examine what you're doing and why, you might realise you don't
            actually want what you're chasing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trying things helps, but it often ends up akin to throwing darts
            blindfolded if not paired with introspection. You can do anything, but
            not everything. At some point, you have to stop and ask what's
            actually worth doing instead of just staying busy.
          </p>

          <p>
            What surprised me wasn't that freedom fell short, but how quietly it
            did so. There was no crash or notable breaking point. Just a slow
            fading of what I could only describe as purpose. The more options I
            had, the less any of them seemed to matter. It occurred to me that
            direction may play a bigger part than variety in feeling alive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having mistaken the byproduct—happiness—for the source, I realised the
            real question isn't "How can I have everything?" It's "Am I doing the
            one thing that matters most to me right now?" That answer won't come
            through ephemeral deliberation. You have to write it down.
          </p>
