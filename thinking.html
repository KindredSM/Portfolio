        <p>If you feel lost, write.</p>

        <p>
          Most people mistake noise in their head for thought. If something
          feels off in your life, you probably haven't written about it yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned this after six months of what I thought was freedom. Travel,
          flexibility, no real obligations. But once I took a day to be still, I
          saw what I'd been missing. I didn't need to escape responsibility, I
          needed control over my attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          This distinction matters. We talk a lot about freedom, but not enough
          about intention. The world is splitting into those who write (and
          think) and those who don't. I was close to becoming one of the latter.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's easy to drift into a passive state, especially when everything
          around you is optimised for distraction. To escape that, you have to
          act deliberately. Clear thinking isn't automatic. In fact, the more
          capable you are, the easier it is to waste that potential chasing the
          wrong things. Potency without clarity is dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to get clarity is to shift mental modes from reacting to
          reflecting. Most people operate on autopilot. But if you take time to
          really examine what you're doing and why, you might realise you don't
          actually want what you're chasing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trying things helps, but only if paired with introspection. Without
          that, you just stay busy. You can do anything, but not everything. At
          some point, you have to stop and ask what's actually worth doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea of total freedom sounds appealing until you get it. Then it
          gets boring. Working from anywhere, meeting new people every night, it
          starts to feel the same. You return to your baseline, wondering why
          the life you thought you wanted still feels as though it's missing
          something.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where people mistake happiness for fulfilment. They’re not the
          same. Happiness is a byproduct—not something you reach by trying to
          escape responsibility and pressure, or by chasing it directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually I realised the real question isn't "How can I have
          everything?" It's "Am I done yet?" Do I know what's enough? That's the
          tradeoff between optionality and focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that answer won't come by thinking vaguely. You have to write it
          down.
