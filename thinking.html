        <p>If you feel lost, write.</p>

        <p>
          Most people mistake noise in their head for thought. If something
          feels off in your life, you probably haven't written about it yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned this after six months of what I thought was freedom. Travel,
          flexibility, no real obligations. But once I took a day to be still, I
          saw what I'd been missing. I didn't need to escape responsibility, I
          needed control over my attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          This distinction matters. We talk a lot about freedom, but not enough
          about intention. The world seems to be splitting into those who write
          (and think) and those who don't. I was close to becoming one of the
          latter.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's easy to drift into a passive state, especially when everything
          around you is optimised for distraction. To escape that, you have to
          act deliberately. Clear thinking isn't automatic. In fact, the more
          capable you are, the easier it is to waste that potential chasing the
          wrong things. Potency without clarity is dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to get clarity is to shift mental modes from reacting to
          reflecting. Most people operate on autopilot. But if you take time to
          really examine what you're doing and why, you might realise you don't
          actually want what you're chasing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trying things helps, but it often ends up akin to throwing darts
          blindfolded if not paired with introspection. You can do anything, but
          not everything. At some point, you have to stop and ask what's
          actually worth doing instead of just staying busy.
        </p>

        <p>
          What surprised me wasn’t that freedom fell short, but how quietly it
          did so. There was no crash or notable breaking point. Just a slow
          fading of what I could only describe as purpose. The more options I
          had, the less any of them seemed to matter. It occurred to me that
          direction may play a bigger part than variety in feeling alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had mistaken happiness for fulfilment. They’re not the same.
          Happiness is a byproduct—not something you reach by trying to escape
          responsibility and pressure, or by chasing it directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, I realised the real question isn’t “How can I have
          everything?” It’s “Am I doing the one thing that matters most to me
          right now?” That answer won’t come through ephemeral deliberation. You
          have to write it down.
